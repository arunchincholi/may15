# an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum
#list in the python is the its sequence type datatype ex:list the ec2 instance where as for tuple store the administration names.
# its mutable (you can bale to add and renove the valuues from list.)  there is no append and remove default method.  v_name.append(5)
# values stored in the [square brackets]   where as tuple (square bracket) and immutable(cant add and remove the value from list once creation done.)
# it consumes more memory and from performance issue list is good compare to this coz its immutable.
# accessing the list by using th eindexing number start from 0
# in list we can store any type of data type (bollean, int, float,logical etc.) in python no need to explict type data_type beyond variable_name 
     #because its dynamic langauge.
#while doing the sort method typo error coz it must be same data  type in the list or tuple 
# append add the value at the end but you can remove anything from the list
